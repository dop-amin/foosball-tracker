Script to recalculate ELO ratings and populate historical leaderboard snapshots.
Run this after any migration that affects player ratings or game history.

This script performs two operations:
1. Recalculates all ELO ratings from scratch by replaying games chronologically
2. Populates historical leaderboard snapshots (daily position tracking)
